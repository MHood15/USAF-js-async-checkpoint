/* Create a command line application that processes a file list of pokemon names (each name seperated by a new line) and logs each Pokemon's types (for some there are many) according to the pokeapi.co API.

This is an assessment of both your understanding of the course material so far and your ability to independently problem solve and use the internet/other resources to implement anything you don't understand. */

 /* 
 Input - receiving input from the Pokemon API via fetch calls
         also taking in list of Pokemons from a .txt file as the function input

 Output - console.log text strings of each Pokemon and its type

 Constraints - none (?)

 Edge Cases - none right now to be considered

 Explanation - I will get a list of all the Pokemons and put them into an array, then using a FETCH command from the Poke API I will fetch each Pokemon type presumably using a loop and then output as a series of strings to the console (sounds easy)

 https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/pikachu/

 Steps: 
   1. Obtain the list of Pokemons and put them into an array
   2. Fetch each Pokemon's exhaustive list of traits (or whatever) from the API
     this link: https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/pikachu/
   3. Parse out the Pokemon type from the API output
     Saved as an object
     May have multiple types
   4. Save the type to the associated Pokemon and print it out
   5. If time, do all the other stuff to make it work like running fetch on repl.it
